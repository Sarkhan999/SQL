----------Using Set Operators----------

Include:
	1. UNION
	2. UNION ALL
	3. INTERSECT
	4. MINUS

	* order by could be used in last SELECT statement
	* BLOB and CLOB could not be used
	* data types should match, or at least implicitly converted
	* number of columns should be same
	
Intersect:
	* removes duplicate values
	??? check duplicates

MINUS:
	??? DUplicates?



Combinations of set operators:
	* same prioroity, it means it will be executed by order 1,2,3 ...
	* to prioritize use paranthesis
	* Order by should be used at the end
	??? what if order by will be used in the center?
	
Order by:
	* by Position:
		select CUSTOMER_NO from sc
		union
		select CUSTOMER_NO from scp
		order by 1 desc
		
	* by reference:
		- only use name of the first table
		select CUSTOMER_NO from sc
		union
		select CIF from scp
		order by CUSTOMER_NO desc
